# Library_Management_CLi
🚀 Java — I implemented a Library Management application in Core Java to practice real-world OOP: • Inheritance between Book → Story / Subject   • Method overriding for Details()   • Polymorphism: upcasting  and downcasting    • ArrayList for storage, custom sorting (by price descending), search, remove, display, and total price calculation .
